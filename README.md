# 🔐 Automated Redaction with Encoder + PATE-GAN

An AI-powered web app that automatically redacts personally identifiable information (PII) from text using a combination of a custom encoder model, pre-trained Hugging Face transformers, and privacy-preserving techniques via PATE-GAN.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **Custom Encoder**: Trained from scratch in PyTorch to learn semantic structure of text.
- 🤖 **Hugging Face Redaction**: Utilizes a powerful NER model to detect sensitive entities like names, locations, phone numbers, etc.
- 🧪 **PATE-GAN**: Integrated for enhanced privacy guarantees via synthetic data generation.
- 🌐 **Streamlit UI**: Simple and interactive frontend to upload and redact documents.
- 📓 **Colab Notebook**: Training and experimentation for the encoder is available in Jupyter format.
